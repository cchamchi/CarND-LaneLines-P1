**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of big 4 steps. First, I founded lane edges in the pitctue using canny algorithm. before the canny

I have to convert/modify the picture for the canny algorithm to find edges well. Because canny algorithm calculate gradient with

gray scale image, I converted target image to gray and modified it less sensitive using gaussian-blurr with kernel size 5

I tried 3/5/7 size of kernel, size 5 was best. 

The second is pick the

I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to ...
